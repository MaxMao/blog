Since the IPO of my company, some early members left the company to pursue new startup opportunities. After they left, some internal services and libraries become less and less loved. Although the original idea is innovative, new developers just don't want to maintain other developers' code.

You can't keep everyone in the team forever. So maybe opensourcing is a good way to make it live.
